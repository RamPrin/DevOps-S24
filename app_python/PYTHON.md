# Time Table app development

## Development

I've decided to run simple web server using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework.
It's pretty easy and fast framework for simple web applications.

## Quality

In order to ensure code quality, I used [RuFF](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) exstension and integrated
RuFF Github Action into github repository.

## Testing

As a result, application shows time on every page refresh:
